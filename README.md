# **Software for Visualization, Segmentation, and Sonification of Ultrasonic Vocalizations of Laboratory Rats**

## Description
Ultrasonic vocalizations of laboratory rats serve as a crucial communication tool in behavioral studies. This project focuses on developing software capable of analyzing recordings of ultrasonic communication and behavior in rats. The goal is to create a tool for segmenting and detecting these signals and enabling their sonification, supporting research into cooperative behavior and vocal communication in laboratory rats.

## Supervisor

## Requirements
1. Conduct a literature review on existing approaches to analyzing ultrasonic vocalizations and evaluate software implementation possibilities.  
2. Implement methods for segmenting and detecting ultrasonic vocalizations.  
3. Evaluate the detection accuracy using available methods.  
4. Implement sonification of ultrasonic signals from laboratory rats.  
5. The software should allow easy signal editing and manipulation and be ready for the integration of potential recognition and classification modules.
